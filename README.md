this dashboard shows oil data and visualizes the data in various ways, there are pie charts, line charts etc. it is not meant to be complicated everything is simple just showing a dash app in action.

Pandas has been used to clean and prepare the code for visualization.
dash bootstrap has also been used to make the dashboard alittle bit more appealing...

dash is a fairly new framework although it might not when you're reading this

its code looks kinda messy but it does the work and simplifies it,

you can learn more about dash in it's documentation....
